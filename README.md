# Lightium

You can contribute by giving idea,  or method to improve the engine.

# List TODO:
-Collision
-Real 3D Terrai
-New Method to render terrain, so we can render wall , etc..(with Vertex,LineDefs , etc.. like doom maps , but in more advanced)
-Sounds(The system works)

# To read!
Since I don't have the time to work on it, and to be honest, the render engine is not good at all, I am putting this project on hold. Moreover java is not good for 3D game, for real....
When i will find the time, i will work on a C++/C# version after I will finish my new main project.
