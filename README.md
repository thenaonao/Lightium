# List TODO:

-New Method to render terrain, so we can render wall , etc..(with Vertex,LineDefs , etc.. like doom maps , but in more advanced)

#To read!
Since I don't have the time to work on it, and to be honest, the render engine is not good at all. Moreover java is not good for 3D game, for real....
When i will find the time, i will work on a c++/cs version after i will finish my new main project.
